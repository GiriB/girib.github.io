While browsing through admin templates for a project of mine, I came across [gentelella](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella). It's a Bootstrap3 template with useful jQuery plugins and tools. I decided to use it with my existing Django project. The github repo had a NodeJS application demo code. I spent some time reading the source, trying to find out the least number of changes (read: copy and paste) I'd have to do to make it work for me. After spending quite a while, I realised that I can help other Django developers who decide to use gentelella in the future. 

So I made a bare minimum Django app with gentellela integrated (read: rearranging the resources in proper folders, replacing/renaming routes the Django way). I'm glad that many people are finding it useful. My first project to be starred from fellow developers!
